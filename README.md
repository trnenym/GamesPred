#GamesPred

GamesPred was developed to provide predictions of how a game released on Steam will be successful. This includes games not yet announced. The average number of concurrent players in 2 months after the release is used to measure a game's success. This has been calculated from steamcharts.com for roughly 4,600 games which are used to make predictions about new games. Free-to-play and Early Access titles were left out of the study and it is therefore recommended not to use this tool on them. In addition, only games from a developer/publisher with at least 2 games in the database can be reliably predicted. The application notifies you immediately if this condition is not satisfied.
