The duo knows the secret chakra technique like the back of their hand (or hoof in Pony s case). Together they rule the city and its surroundings. Although everyone respects and fears them they are hunted by law enforcement agencies. They are Ninjas. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon (CPHD) is a brand-new Action RPG game developed for SNK s Neo Geo console which came out in 1990. It might look like a straight-forward arcade game, but under the surface is a persistent world with a rich and varied set of rules. In CPHD Run N Gun mechanics from the likes Shock Troopers or Ninja commando are combined with playful RPG ones from games like Zelda or Secret of Mana. You ll need to explore every level to find the resources necessary for your progress: coins, health bonuses, resurrection potions, special Ninja techniques, etc. Treasure chests are hidden everywhere. You ll have to find them to afford equipment upgrades from the ninja shops. In addition Pony and Biki gain experience points by defeating enemies, becoming more powerful over time. Be careful though: you ll have to use your resources wisely. Health is limited so if you don t equip yourself at the armory you re in for a hard time. Money is limited too however: you ll need to choose these investments carefully! Make new friends: a local multiplayer co-op mode lets a second player drop in at any time. It s even more fun, even more frantic and even more strategic! Lose old friends: there are the same numbers of resources no matter how many players there are; will you share or will you hog everything? Have a good adventure!Why create a game for Neo Geo? Several reasons pushed us to develop for this console. The Neo-Geo is a legend amongst consoles, and is the one we dreamed of throughout our childhood and teenage years. For this reason, when we decided to bring our main character Ninja Pony to life, we wanted his early adventures to take place in the Neo-Geo universe. Thus we are offering our beloved Pony this welcoming present: to be born into the world of this Rolls Royce of consoles. Having our character emerge on cartridge is a way of enshrining him in the Pantheon of video game heroes, alongside Sonic and Mario. It s a way of going back in time! It also made sense with regards to the character s back-story. Crouching Pony Hidden Dragon relates the teenage years of Ninja Pony. This parallels the advent of the Neo-Geo in the history of video games: this console personifies gaming s teenage years. Last but not least there were technical challenges we were eager to overcome. We realized that there were very few traces of the tools and documentation required to develop games on Neo-Geo. What s more this arcane knowledge was gradually disappearing! We had to become archaeologists, investigating, looking for clues, piecing together how these games were developed. We created our own software and hardware pipe-lines, started working directly in pixel art again, etc. We were able to leverage our experience working on modern video games in returning to blow the dust off these old techniques. It was an exciting job, a true act of video game craftsmanship!Why bring the game to PC? When we announced the Neo Geo version many expressed regret at not being able to play the game. Since our main ambition at Le Cortex is to offer original play experiences to as many people as possible we wanted to avoid restricting the release to Neo-Geo connoisseurs and collectors. So we decided to port the game to the gamers platform of today: the PC. And in case you were wondering this is indeed a full native port, not the Neo-Geo ROM being run via an emulator!About Le Cortex Le Cortex is an independent French Studio located in Paris.

As a result, you, Angela Burnes, US citizen, are trapped in the metropolitan capital of San Bav n. Your paradise has turned into a warzone. To make ends meet, you take up a job as a housekeeper. Every week, an hour before sunset, you clean the swanky bachelor pad of the wealthy Gabriel Ortega. You are given a number of tasks to do, but the temptation to go through his stuff is irresistible. And what is he up to? As you get to know your mysterious absent employer better, you are sucked into a rebellious plot against the notorious dictator who rules the country with an iron fist. Sunset uses the routine of labour to exquisite effect as a framework to tell a story about class and political revolution. Simon Parkin, Eurogamer Sunset acts as a thoughtful, pensive walk through social themes and struggles not often explored in this medium. Game Spot, Josiah Renaudin Sunset is a wonderfully atmospheric slow burner and a valuable addition to a medium where the predominant approach to conflict is to just give you a big old gun and invite you to get stuck in. Philippa Warr, Rock Paper Shotgun The story is excellent and will draw you in, making you feel as if you truly are Angela Burnes. Jessica Mock, Hardcore Gamer Rather than focus on the explicit violence of a military coup, Sunset centers on the emotional brutality of war.

Sunset is in part inspired by action games set in a war-like context, like many first-person shooters. What life would be like for the NPCs in such games? How does it feel when war is the backdrop for your day-to-day life? Sunset is divided into 44 play sessions that each take a fictional hour: until the sun sets. Each time you get a list of tasks that you are requested to do. But there is more to do in the apartment than just work. There are other activities, such as going through the owner s possessions in search of information, and interacting with his 1970s-era technological gadgets. Angela Burnes, is not an empty vessel. She has a personality of her own and you discover her thoughts while playing. As a US citizen at the end of the sixties, she is inspired by the Black Power and civil rights movements. In an effort to learn more about egality, she travels to the then socialist republic of Anchuria. During her visit, a US-backed military coup happens and she is disallowed from leaving the country. Her university degree is not recognized by the new regime and she is forced to work as a housekeeper to sustain herself. Angela s younger brother, David, who had followed her to Anchuria ends up joining an underground resistance movement. And Angela must worry about what happens to him when the war begins in earnest. Gabriel Ortega is a lover of the arts. Through his work as a curator he met Maria Luisa of the wealthy Veleta family. Thanks to the money from their families, Gabriel became a much celebrated benefactor of the arts. When the coup happened, theaters and museums were closed. The new government offered affluent citizens safety and positions of power. Gabriel s wife, and most of her family and their friends, were happy to accept but Gabriel refused. Rising tensions between the couple ultimately lead to a separation. The story of Sunset begins when Gabriel Ortega moves into a new penthouse apartment in the capital city of San Bav n.

Move Brad around the battlefield and dodge incoming enemy attacks and projectiles. Brad is constantly playing his axe-lute and generating notes, standing still will cause him to jam and generate notes even faster.

328990,1,1,0.12,'Koya Rift is an action-packed platform shooter that is built around circular, adaptive gameplay that emphasizes replay value by challenging the player with procedural content tuned to their skill level. In Koya Rift, the player must enter a hostile planet and destroy an alien race so the planet can be colonized. Each game, the player is dropped off at the surface and must venture into procedurally generated caves, earning upgrades and buying units as he goes along. The difficulty adjusts precisely to the skill of the player over time, providing them with a consistent challenge. The goal of the game is to provide a challenging, yet casual experience that s easy to pick up and put down. A game of Koya Rift is pretty straightforward you find yourself above ground standing in front of one of the delivery pods from the mercenary mothership. Your minimap hides the area below ground and you have no idea what awaits you. The terrain of each level is procedurally generated (meaning it uses advanced algorithms to make itself different every time, providing nearly endless possibilities). Below ground lies a web of tunnels and caverns that is different every single time you play. It s impossible to know what awaits you behind every corner. Procedural generation isn t just in the level all of your enemies will seem different too. Their size, speed, color, health, damage, and weapon behavior will be unique for each one you fight. Your own weapons are generated the same way the Lances you bring along with you to levels are generated out of endless possibilities. One gun may fire large, single shot energy blasts that slow down and weaken all enemies in a large radius, where another gun will shoot bursts of many bullets that curve in every direction with a waving motion, another gun that fires several shots at once but can pierce through walls and home after enemies, and another that heals and enhances your allies. You have to venture down into the unfamiliar cave system and eliminate all of the Phantom Crystals (Where the enemy soldiers are grown). Unfortunately the Phantoms are hunting you the whole time, while their crystals evolve and grow. If you manage to destroy all the enemy crystals, you win the level. Don t get too proud though if you beat it too easily the game will know and will be sure to adjust the difficulty for next time. Game difficulty in Koya Rift is complex it s not a simple modification to the amount of health you have, and it isn t a simple easy-normal-hard scale. Difficulty is a very precise unit of measurement that expands near-infinitely in either direction in this game. If you beat your last couple of levels easily it will slightly increase, if you keep getting beaten down without a fight it will decrease to help you out. Difficulty adjustments affect almost everything in game from the reaction speed of the Phantoms, to the speed at which they grow and evolve, to the cost of your allies, the experience they need to level up, the accuracy, size, fire rate, and density of your energy weapons, the rate of health recovery, the effects of special weapons, the size of the levels you play on, the health and damage of your enemies, the speed and fragility of your allies, the cash value of killing an opponent, the swiftness and force of enemy attacks, and even more. There are so many values that change, and when they do change, they change with such subtlety that you will not be able to pick out exactly why this next game seems like more of a challenge for you than last, or why you re finally able to beat that one level that you were stuck on for so long. These items combine to create an excellent formula for expandable gameplay in the end you have a game that you can always come back to and find something different, and always be challenged regardless of your ability.'
